Team-SRC Plus Plus Master
==========

The Master SRC for Team SRC++

The license is the Team SRC++ Public License 1.0, the Open one is planned to replace it, but is currently under construction, therefor isn't valid and isn't permitted to use.

Well, now that we have all that out of the way, let's start talking about other stuff relating to this.
For one,

Branches
==========
There are two, master and Experimental, the latter will be the most updated and the former (master) will contain every full version. the Experimental is like a preview system!

Joining
==========
You can join this project by joining the Team, after that, the Master Source will be open for you to program to. This takes some trust, so you will have to show we can trust you.
